          traveled to the riches of the AmericaS
          I have traveled so far from my homes
          I have faced so many challenges/pain
          I have spoken so many languages
          for what reason good or bad I am yet to see
          I have shed so many tears
          I have lost so many friends, family and acquaintances
          OH MAN, the pain turned to a sweet one..</blockquote>
